## Introduction
In today's data-driven world, customer reviews are a valuable resource for businesses seeking to improve their products and services. This project demonstrates the process of web scraping to collect reviews from a hotel website and perform sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction. The project involves several stages, from data collection and cleaning to sentiment analysis and visualization of results.

## Project Objectives
Scrape customer reviews from a hotel review website using Python and BeautifulSoup.
Preprocess and clean the collected data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
Perform sentiment analysis on the reviews to determine the polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and subjectivity (opinion-based vs. fact-based).
Visualize the results to provide a clear understanding of customer sentiment.
Derive insights that can help hotel management improve their services and address customer concerns.
## Tools and Libraries Used
Python: The core programming language used for the entire project.
BeautifulSoup: Used for web scraping to extract data from HTML pages.
Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and organization into DataFrames.
NLTK: Applied for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and stopword removal.
TextBlob: Used for sentiment analysis, calculating polarity, and subjectivity scores.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing the results of the sentiment analysis.
## Data Collection
The data was collected by scraping customer reviews from a hotel review website. The reviews were extracted using BeautifulSoup, a powerful Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. The scraper navigated through multiple pages, ensuring a comprehensive dataset was gathered. The data collected included:

Review Text
Review Date
Review Rating (if available)
Additional metadata such as the reviewer's location (if available)
## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Once the data was collected, it underwent a thorough cleaning process to ensure its quality. This involved:

Removing HTML tags and other non-text elements.
Eliminating special characters and numbers that are not relevant to the sentiment analysis.
Tokenizing the text into individual words and removing stopwords (common words that do not contribute much to the sentiment, like "and", "the", etc.).
Normalizing the text by converting it to lowercase and handling negations.
## Sentiment Analysis
The cleaned data was then subjected to sentiment analysis using NLTK and TextBlob. The analysis involved:

Polarity Calculation: Measuring how positive, negative, or neutral each review is.
Subjectivity Calculation: Assessing whether a review is more opinion-based or fact-based.
Categorization: Grouping the reviews into positive, negative, and neutral categories based on their polarity scores.
## Results and Insights
The sentiment analysis revealed the following insights:

Overall Sentiment Distribution: A breakdown of how many reviews were positive, negative, or neutral.
Key Drivers of Sentiment: Common themes in positive and negative reviews, providing insight into what customers like and dislike.
Visualization: The results were visualized using bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds to make the insights more accessible.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of combining web scraping with sentiment analysis to extract and understand customer feedback. The insights gained from this analysis can help hotel management improve their services, enhance customer satisfaction, and address areas of concern.
